This visualization teaches about retirement savings through interactive visualizations. This project was motivated by the fact that I myself knew very little about this but was always told by my (mother's) finacial advisor that I, as a young (poor) student, should be contributing to a Roth IRA account. Therefore, I created a visualization in order to intuitively compare the difference between Roth and traditional accounts. Through these visualizations, I want to increase financial understanding of retirement and create impactful visualizations that might motivate people to start saving more at younger ages.

The user is able to input the amount of money that they will contribute each year for X number of years, and see different visualizations for Roth IRA and various other “traditional” accounts. Moreover, I visualize average retirement savings for each decade bracket (twenty year olds, thirty year olds, etc.). The user can input her age bracket, salary, and current savings, and in return see if she has more or less saved as compared with others of the same age and income bracket. 

The main difference between Roth IRA and traditional accounts is that:
•	You contribute to a Roth IRA after your income is taxed (i.e. you pay taxes on the contributed sum). However, all of the earnings are not taxed when you withdraw it after retirement (i.e. no taxes on withdrawn amount).
•	You contribute to traditional accounts before taxes (i.e. contributions are not taxed). However, all of the earning are taxed when withdrawn after retirement (i.e. taxes on all earnings)
